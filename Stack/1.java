Sure! Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some of the most important types of stack problems you'll encounter on LeetCode, including key techniques and word explanations for each type:

### 1. **Valid Parentheses**

**Problem Type:** Check if a string of parentheses is valid (i.e., every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis).

**Key Techniques:**
- **Use of Stack:** Push each opening parenthesis onto the stack. For each closing parenthesis, pop from the stack and check if it matches the type of opening parenthesis.
- **Balance Check:** Ensure that the stack is empty at the end of the traversal, which indicates that all parentheses were matched correctly.

**Example:** `"()"`, `"(a+b)"`, `"([{}])"`

### 2. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**

**Problem Type:** Evaluate an expression given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) where operators follow their operands.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Stack-based Evaluation:** Push operands onto the stack. When encountering an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
- **Operator Handling:** Handle basic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` (integer division).

**Example:** `"2 1 + 3 *"` evaluates to `9`.

### 3. **Daily Temperatures**

**Problem Type:** Given a list of daily temperatures, find out how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Monotonic Stack:** Use a stack to keep track of indices of temperatures in decreasing order. For each temperature, pop from the stack until finding a warmer temperature, and compute the difference in indices.

**Example:** `[73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`

### 4. **Next Greater Element**

**Problem Type:** For each element in an array, find the next greater element that appears later in the array.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Monotonic Stack:** Use a stack to keep track of elements for which the next greater element is yet to be determined. As you traverse the array, update the next greater elements using the stack.

**Example:** `[4, 5, 2, 10]` has next greater elements `[5, 10, 10, -1]`.

### 5. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**

**Problem Type:** Given a histogram represented by an array of heights, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in the histogram.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Stack-based Heights Tracking:** Use a stack to keep track of bar indices in increasing height order. Calculate areas whenever a shorter bar is encountered.

**Example:** `[2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]` has a largest rectangle area of `10`.

### 6. **Remove Invalid Parentheses**

**Problem Type:** Given a string with invalid parentheses, remove the minimum number of parentheses to make the string valid.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Backtracking with Stack:** Use a backtracking approach combined with a stack to try removing different parentheses and check if the resultant string is valid.

**Example:** `"(a)())()"` can be made valid as `"a()()"` or `"a()()"`.

### 7. **Evaluate Expression Tree**

**Problem Type:** Given an expression tree, evaluate its result.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Recursive Evaluation:** Recursively evaluate left and right subtrees. Apply the operator at the current node to the results from the left and right subtrees.

**Example:** An expression tree with root `+` and children `2` and `3` evaluates to `5`.

### 8. **Basic Calculator**

**Problem Type:** Evaluate a basic mathematical expression given as a string with non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `(`, and `)`.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Two Stacks:** Use one stack for operators and another for operands. Handle parentheses and operator precedence during evaluation.

**Example:** `"1 + (2 - (3 + 4))"` evaluates to `-4`.

### 9. **Longest Valid Parentheses**

**Problem Type:** Find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Stack-based Approach:** Track indices of unmatched parentheses. Use these indices to compute lengths of valid substrings.

**Example:** `"(()))())("` has the longest valid parentheses substring of length `4` (`"(())"`).

### 10. **Remove Duplicate Letters**

**Problem Type:** Remove duplicate letters from a string such that the result is the lexicographically smallest possible string.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Stack and Greedy Approach:** Use a stack to build the smallest lexicographical order while ensuring that each character is only used once.

**Example:** `"cbacdcbc"` results in `"acdb"`.

Understanding these types of problems and techniques will help you tackle a wide range of stack-related problems on LeetCode effectively.
